      "acquisition": "I am Chitose, light carrier of the Sakura Empire. Commander, I look forward to receiving your guidance. By the way, is it true that Chiyoda is also here? ...Don't worry, I was merely inquiring.",

      "secretaryIdle2": "Chiyoda always insists on doing my hair this way, so I let her. However, I always feel a bit apologetic for making her do so much...",
      "secretaryIdle3": "I'm at least confident in my Kagura dancing skills. If you get the chance, please come and watch.",

      "secretaryIdle2": "Chiyoda's quite the sore loser... She's like that even when it comes to building sand castles, so I can't even imagine how worked up she'd get over beach volleyball... If that pink-haired union girl is our opponent, I think I'll just sit out...",
      "secretaryIdle3": "The weather forecast says... it'll be clear until the evening... Mmn...",

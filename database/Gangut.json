Both humans and ships are alike in their quest for greater power, to protect what they otherwise would not be able to. That is революция, the revolution I strive for! From the Bering Sea to Leningrad, only by rising up in the face of humiliation was I able to become a beacon for the light of glory!",

      "secretaryTouch": "What about my rigging? Isn't fully utilizing everything at your disposal a wonderful and pragmatic ideal? Why would I consign myself to weakness for the sake of showmanship?",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "What are you doing, comrade? Are you not aware of how we handle lawbreakers in the Northern Parliament?",

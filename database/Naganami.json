During the War, I was primarily involved in transport operations, but I did participate in some large-scale operations and even served as flagship. Any hardship on the battlefield can be overcome as long as you believe in one another... I just know it!",
      "acquisition": "So this place is the port? Huh... Oh, Commander! I'm the fourth ship of the Yuugumo class, Naganami. It's a pleasure to finally meet you! Um... what's my selling point... Love! I love you, and everyone else as well!",

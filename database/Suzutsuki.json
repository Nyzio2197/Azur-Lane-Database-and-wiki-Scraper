I was a member of the 61st DesDiv along with Akizuki and Hatsuzuki, and escorted Musashi and participated in Noshiro's rescue mission! Not a shabby record, right? I had a close call at the Battle of Bou-no-Misaki when I got hit by two torpedoes, but I managed to survive until the end!",
      "acquisition": "Ahaha, Pooky, listen up, we're gonna live here from now on! Uhh... Third ship of the Akizuki-class, Suzutsuki, reporting in! I'll be the one to protect my comrades and you, Commander! Just kidding~?",

      "secretaryIdle3": "Commander, you sure have a lot of work, don't you~ Look, Isokaze, Urakaze, being a warlord or a general is a lot of hard work. A better job would be to become Commander's retainers!",
      "secretaryTouch": "This marking on my right cheek? You haven't heard of it, Commander? It's the latest fashion trend! Here, I'll draw one on for you!",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "C-Commander! Jeez, there are some things that you shouldn't be doing!",

      "selfIntroduction": "I'm Grenville, Royal G-class Destroyer. I served as the lead ship and flagship of a destroyer squadron! However, it's a darn shame that I didn't leave behind much of a legacy because of my short service. If there's anything special I'd like you to know, um, I'm not fond of naval mines...",
      "acquisition": "Heyyo~ Good morning, Commander! G-class Destroyer, Grenville, reporting for duty! Now that I'm here, you can leave everything to me and take a nap! Hehe, just kidding~ Let's get along well, all right?",
      "login": "Commander, welcome back! Did you sleep well? If so, let's get started with today's work!",
      "details": "Commander, I steeped tea according to Miss Hood's instructions. Care to try? Huh...? It's too sweet...? Ahaha... I suppose that big ol' scoop of honey was a bit overkill...",
      "secretaryIdle1": "Hehe, Commander, would you like to study etiquette with me~? For example, take this fine lady's hand gracefully like this~",
      "secretaryIdle2": "As a lead ship, it's only right that I become a pillar of strength! Hehe~ Because of that, I'll continue to work hard!",
      "secretaryIdle3": "Even though I may be inexperienced, I have nothing to fear! What matters is the ability to overcome any adversity in the future... Hehe, sounds like I'm beginning to boast~",
      "secretaryTouch": "Ahh... If only I could become an elegant lady like Miss Hood~",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "Woah?! Gosh... I'm going to get angry! Commander, you have to conduct yourself appropriately!",

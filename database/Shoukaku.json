Because my super smart senpai went and got themselves all killed, I had to carry the flag of the Sakura Empire¡¯s carrier divisions. Though I was more accomplished than them, for whatever reason, I was always considered weaker. Maybe it was due to my \"lack of grace and speed\" during my final moments... With that said, allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Shoukaku, the punching bag of the Sakura Empire. Please take care of me from now on~",

      "selfIntroduction": "I am Tosa, the first Tosa-class battleship. My construction began long ago, but its completion never came... I have been an aircraft carrier, a battleship, a weapons testbed, and a target; they worked and reworked me to the bone. But now I am here, in this form, and I will not disappoint you.",
      "acquisition": "I am the nameship of the Tosa-class battleships, Tosa. I only serve those who I deem worthy. As for you... Well, I do not believe in making hasty judgments. For the time being, let me first assess your abilities.",

      "secretaryIdle2": "I do not shy away from using any trick required to achieve my goals. I would rather that than play by the rules and end up at the bottom of the sea.",
      "secretaryIdle3": "Stay behind if you cannot fight. The weak should know their place from the strong C this is the belief my sister holds.",
      "secretaryIdle4": "I am neither as forward-thinking as Amagi, nor as short-fused as my sister. What? What's incorrect? The part about my sister, or my description of myself?",

      "secretarySpecialTouch": "Acting on a momentary impulse can have deadly repercussions. I do hope you're not getting any outlandish ideas.",

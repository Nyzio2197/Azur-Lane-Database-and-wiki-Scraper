I'm the first aircraft carrier specifically designed and built for the role in the Royal Navy, I'm proud of being a prototype to all other carriers that followed. Little needs to be said about my feats against the Bismarck. Rather I must ask, are there any of those cute little destroyers in our fleet?",

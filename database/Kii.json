But now I have, and I'm going to use it to its fullest! If you have anything that needs doing, just say the word, Commander!",

      "details": "Obviously I like being on the center stage with my massive cannons. Performance aside, their size alone boosts morale while intimidating the enemy. You get what I mean, Commander?",

      "secretarySpecialTouch": "\"Friendly friskiness,\" is it? Hmm... Sure, I guess?",

      "details": "Look, isn't Elizabeth acting a bit too spoiled? And Warspite and the others are totally enabling that. I knew I should have been the one in charge... Huhh? I'm more or less the same...? Wh-what did you say?!",

      "secretaryTouch": "Speak your mind, my attendant. You have my ear.",

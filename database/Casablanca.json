      "selfIntroduction": "Back then, roughly fifty other Casablanca-class sisters entered service over the course of just over a year. Although most of us saw our missions come to an end shortly after the war, I will do my best to fulfill my duties to this fleet, whether as an escort, air support, or a transport. It's a pleasure to work with you, Commander.",

      "secretaryIdle4": "I'm not a fan of battling, but if anyone picks a fight with me, then a fight they'll get. We were made to wage war, and so that is our responsibility.",
      "secretaryIdle5": "Life is so peaceful at this port. For that, we can thank the many girls here who I don't hold as much as a candle to.",

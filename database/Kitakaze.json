      "acquisition": "Indeed, the preparations are complete... Now that I, Kitakaze, shall be assisting you with your operational command, you can now sleep more soundly at night, Commander. Heheh!",

      "details": "Those who lead upon the battlefield must also carry their own blade... Worry not, this one is not heavy at all.",
      "secretaryIdle1": "My Akizuki-class sisters have always taken good care of me. I, Kitakaze, swear to meet their expectations, and will work hard to protect everyone.",
      "secretaryIdle2": "I prefer strategizing and leading from the rear over fighting in the frontlines... B-but I¡¯m perfectly capable of fighting head on.",
      "secretaryIdle3": "True power comes from the strength of one¡¯s convictions. It would behoove you to not underestimate my abilities!",
      "secretaryTouch": "Being small has its advantages... Heheh. For example, don¡¯t even try to hit me in a game of dodgeball!",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "Hmm... The responsibility of cleaning up your conduct weighs heavily upon me, but... please cease your crass behavior.",

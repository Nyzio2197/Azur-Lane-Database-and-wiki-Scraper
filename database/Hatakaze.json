      "selfIntroduction": "I'm Hatakaze, a Kamikaze-class destroyer. Oh, also, though my class might make me seem experienced, not only did I mainly engage in escort missions and achieve nothing spectacular, my story ends with my wish to fight the bitter end, like Kamikaze did, going unfulfilled. For someone like me, that's rather deplorable.",
      "acquisition": "You must be the Commander. I see... No, I'm not looking disgruntled. I'm Hatakaze of Destroyer Division 5. Oh, also, be ready. I will watch over you as your superior from now on.",
      "login": "A commander should at the very least be on time. But considering your achievements up till now, you at least deserve some praise.",
      "details": "Oh, also, did you know my original name was \"Destroyer No. 9\"? ... I suppose it's a good thing they decided to change it.",
      "secretaryIdle1": "I think Matsukaze feels compelled to worry about us so much, and sometimes we don't even know how we should respond...",
      "secretaryIdle2": "If you want to slack off all day, just resign. Oh, also, you have much work left to do.",
      "secretaryIdle3": "Kamikaze, could you stop teasing the Commander?",
      "secretaryTouch": "Anti-air is crucial. Oh, also, the price one pays for negligence is much higher than you think.",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "... Now if you'd just use that bravery for something else, my view of you might actually change.",

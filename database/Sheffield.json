I've basically only fought against Iron Blood, having witnessed the demise of Scharnhorst, and participated in the hunt for Bismarck and Tirpitz. However, I underwent repairs throughout the end of the Second Great War and was unable to sortie. If there's nothing else you'd like to know, I would like to head back now.",

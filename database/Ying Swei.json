      "acquisition": "It is a pleasure to meet you, Commander. I am the elder of the Chao Ho sisters, Ying Swei. Hmm, Chao Ho said that she's the big sister? Hmm, I guess you're not as gullible as she is. Hehe~?",
      "login": "The ever-industrious commander, right on time today. Hey... have you seriously never thought about playing hooky?",
      "details": "Going by launch date, one could say that I am actually Chao Ho's older sister... But alas, since she wants that role so badly, she can have it. Besides, being the \"little sister\" comes with perks of its own. Hehe~?",
      "secretaryIdle1": "Chao Ho, if you want to be seen as the big sister, you're going to have to do things yourself instead of relying on the commander. Heehee~?",
      "secretaryIdle2": "Reminder from Ying Swei~ You've had your head in the clouds for a while~",

      "secretaryTouch": "If you're tired, you should go ahead and rest. Collapsing due to overwork is inefficient.",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "Wouldn't it be a great time for me to tell everyone how much of a pervert you are? If you want me to reconsider, you'll have to make me a little promise first. Hehe~",
      "secretaryHeadpat": "If you mess up my hair, I'll have you style it for me for a week starting tomorrow, you hear?"

      "selfIntroduction": "I'm Eagle Union light cruiser Biloxi. I fought in heaps of battles and carried out many carrier escort missions. Sure, the Cleveland class has its hallmark anti-air fire, but everyone's gotta work together to win. So let's do just that, Commander.",
      "acquisition": "I'm Biloxi. I hope we can work together and seize victory as fellow fleet members. Anyway, that's all for introductions. Nice meeting you.",
      "login": "Mission status: all green. Eyes on the progress, Commander.",
      "details": "Yeah? If you need any help, just say the word. My schedule's pretty packed too, but I can always squeeze in some time to take on your orders.",
      "secretaryIdle1": "\"Big sis\"? Who, me? Ahh, you mean the lead ship. I respect Cleve just as a sister ship. Hahahah!",
      "secretaryIdle2": "We *are* an improved model, but we didn't end up as carriers like Bataan, and our improvements aren't extensive enough to call us part of a subclass. The differences are more obvious through our looks and personalities, though.",

      "secretarySpecialTouch": "One without manners is one garnering contempt. Is that really how you wanna be, Commander?",

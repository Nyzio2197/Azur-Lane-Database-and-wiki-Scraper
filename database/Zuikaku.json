      "selfIntroduction": "I’m Zuikaku from the Fifth Carrier Divison, though I was assigned to the First Carrier Division at one point. Together with my sister Shoukaku, we became the last two elite carriers of the Sakura Empire. We triumphed in bitter battles against Lexington, Hornet, and even Enterprise. That’s right, I was even able to severely damage the Grey Ghost herself, although she proved to be luckier than me. My service came to an end when Lexington, risen from the dead, sunk me. In the end, I still completed my final mission and sank with no regrets.",

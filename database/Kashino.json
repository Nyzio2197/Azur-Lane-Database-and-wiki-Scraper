Um, I was the ship that was created to transport the Yamato-class's 40cm Type 94 gun, but I also participated in various transport missions before finally being sunk by a submarine... Hmm, is that good enough...?",

      "secretaryIdle1": "1, 2, 3... Commander, the supplies you've given me to transport are all accounted for. Hm? It's all right, you don't have to get everyone to help me carry it. It's not very heavy...",
      "secretaryIdle2": "?~ Commander, I brought you your tea. Adding a bit of milk will give it a Royal Navy flair... how about it?",

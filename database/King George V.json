      "selfIntroduction": "The nameship of the King George V-class battleships is none other than me. I served as flagship for my country, leading the fleet into numerous battles including the fateful encounter with Bismarck. After getting a brief taste of that thrill, I have been craving to cross swords with her once again... But I digress - is there anything else you'd like to know about me?",

      "secretaryTouch": "Why do I have a mountain of snacks before me? Isn't it obvious? One cannot move on an empty stomach.",
      "secretarySpecialTouch": "Ohh? I wasn't aware that you possessed such audacity, Commander.",

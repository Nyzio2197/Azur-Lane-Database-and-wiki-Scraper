      "details": "The reason I adore you is because animals take the first person they see to be their lover... Uhh, I mean, their parent! Not that that's got to do with anything! You're my owner just because, and I love you just because! It's as simple as that!",
      "secretaryIdle1": "Hey, Owner, know any funny stories about the Royal Navy? Or any other faction, that's fine! I wanna learn stuff!",
      "secretaryIdle2": "I'm not a cat, okay? I might be as cuddly as a kitten, but I'm not an actual cat!",

      "secretaryHeadpat": "My kitty ears are a detachable hair accessory! You try 'em on too, Owner! Just for a quick moment, please, c'mon!",
